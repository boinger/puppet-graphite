# Module graphite

This module installs and makes basic configs for graphite, with carbon and whisper.

# Tested on
RHEL/CentOS 6+  

# Requirements:

Configure conf files as you need:

templates/opt/graphite/conf/carbon.conf.erb  
templates/opt/graphite/conf/storage-schemas.conf.erb 
templates/opt/graphite/webapp/graphite/local_settings.py.erb

# Sample usage:

node "graphite.my.domain" {
        include graphite
}


### Tuned graphite installation

# This carbon cache will accept TCP and UDP datas and
# the cachesize is limited to 256mb
node "graphite.my.domain" {
  class {'graphite':
    gr_max_cache_size => 256,
    gr_enable_udp_listener => True
  }
}
